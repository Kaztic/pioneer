# World File Update: Adding Supervisor Robot

## Overview

To enable the supervisor controller to read robot positions, you need to add a Supervisor robot node to the Webots world file. This robot will run the supervisor controller and have access to all other robots in the simulation.

## Option 1: Add Supervisor Robot Node (Recommended)

Add this to the end of `worlds/pioneer_world.wbt` (before the closing bracket):

```vrml
Robot {
  controller "supervisor"
  supervisor TRUE
  translation 0 0 0
  children [
    Shape {
      appearance Appearance {
        material Material {
          diffuseColor 0 1 0
          transparency 0.9
        }
      }
      geometry Box {
        size 0.1 0.1 0.1
      }
    }
  ]
  name "supervisor_robot"
}
```

This creates a small, almost invisible Supervisor robot at the origin that runs the supervisor controller.

## Option 2: Modify Existing Robot

Alternatively, you can set one of the existing Pioneer robots to be a supervisor:

1. Open `worlds/pioneer_world.wbt` in Webots
2. Select one robot (e.g., robot_1)
3. In the robot's properties, enable "supervisor" checkbox
4. Change controller to "supervisor"
5. **Note**: This will disable that robot's obstacle avoidance controller

## Option 3: External Supervisor (Alternative Approach)

If you don't want to add a robot to the world, you can run the supervisor controller externally:

1. Compile supervisor controller: `make -C controllers/supervisor`
2. Run it separately: `./controllers/supervisor/supervisor` 
3. **Note**: This won't work because `wb_robot_init()` requires Webots to run it

## Recommended Approach

Use **Option 1** - add a dedicated Supervisor robot node. This:
- Keeps all Pioneer robots with their obstacle avoidance controllers
- Provides a clean separation of concerns
- Is easy to enable/disable

## Verification

After adding the Supervisor robot:

1. Open world in Webots
2. Check Supervisor robot exists (small green box at origin)
3. Run simulation
4. Check `/tmp/pioneer_poses.txt` file is created and updated
5. Check ROS 2 topics are published

## Current World File Status

The world file (`worlds/pioneer_world.wbt`) currently has:
- ✅ DEF names added to all 5 Pioneer robots (`DEF ROBOT_1`, etc.)
- ❌ Supervisor robot node not yet added (you need to add this manually in Webots or edit the file)

To add it programmatically, append the Robot node code above to the world file.
